## How to load the data
The data folder contains a number of data files each containing website data of different size and content. 
For the Search Engine to work properly one of these files must be given as an argument to the SearchEngine. 

For using the search engine with IntelliJ IDEA edit configurations and set "Program arguments" to "./data/enwiki-tiny.txt"

**Have fun using our Search Engine!**
